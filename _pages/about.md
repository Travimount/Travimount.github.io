Hi, My name is Mouxing Yang (Êù®Ë∞ãÊòü). I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student from College of Computer Science, Sichuan Univerisity, fortunately advised by Prof.[Xi Peng](http://pengxi.me).

My research interests mainly focus on Multi-modal Learning and Multi-view Learning, especially the challenges encountered in open scenarios, such as missing modalities, imbalanced modalties and noisy correspondence. For more insights on noisy correspondence, please refer to our repository: [Noisy Correspondence Summary](https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/Awesome-Noisy-Correspondence).
